  constructor() {
    this.assemblyAI = new AssemblyAI();
    this.murfAI = new MurfAI();
    this.websocket = new WebSocket();
  }
  
  async processVoiceInput(audioStream) {
    // Real-time transcription
    const transcript = await this.assemblyAI.transcribe(audioStream);
    
    // Intent processing
    const intent = await this.processIntent(transcript);
    
    // Generate response
    const response = await this.generateResponse(intent);
    
    // Convert to speech with Murf AI
    const audioResponse = await this.murfAI.synthesize(response);
    
    return audioResponse;
  }
}
```

  // Start real-time audio streaming
  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
    .then(stream => {
      const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
      mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = (event) => {
        // Send audio chunks in real-time
        voiceWebSocket.send(event.data);
      };
    });
};

voiceWebSocket.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Receive processed audio response
  const audioResponse = event.data;
  playAudioResponse(audioResponse);
