- [x] 4. Can i have a voice agent to help rural people in performing tasks so that i can use Murf Ai with the best possible , we can have websockets for real time data and assembly ai too... tell me ideas what i can have 

- [x] 5. This voice agent can be implemented alag se , on the Ui so it can be the main part of the project . also im getting same response for weather related question for all the places ... i want the original data ![alt text](image-1.png) , if im logged out then only I'm able to see schemes else after login I'm not able to see also ![alt text](image-2.png) in this image view status is working else check status and apply is not working i want the real schemes and if a person tries to apply he can redirect to the original schemes page 

- [x] 6. ![alt text](image-3.png) this voice agent is disturbing the complete Ui so either we can have a different route for this or we can blur other things if we are opening this voice agent 



- [ ] 7. we have so man mics thing ![alt text](image-4.png) i think we should remove duplicates like we should have one at the footer and three modals are on right side , basically remove the bottom most right most mic icon and remove model from footer , 2 things to remove
